                        Finally, We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if We, or substantially all of the assets relating to AmbianceAccounting, were acquired, or if the AmbianceAccounting business is discontinued or We go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use Your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
