ANY ISSUE CONCERNING THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, OR ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE APPLICABILITY, INTERPRETATION, OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENTION THAT ALL OR PART OF THESE PROCEDURES IS INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND RESOLVED BY THE ARBITRATOR. BY OPERATION OF THIS PROVISION, THE PARTIES AGREE TO FOREGO LITIGATION OVER SUCH DISPUTES IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION SHALL TAKE PLACE IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, ET SEQ. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD NON-MONETARY OR EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY SORT EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN IICPR RULE 13 (INTERIM MEASURES OF PROTECTION). DAMAGES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH ANY APPLICABLE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, THAT ARE PUNITIVE IN NATURE, OR THAT ARE NOT MEASURED BY THE PREVAILING PARTY’S ACTUAL DAMAGES SHALL BE UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR ANY OTHER FORUM. IN NO EVENT, EVEN IF ANY OTHER PORTION OF THESE PROVISIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, SHALL THE ARBITRATOR HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE AN AWARD OR IMPOSE A REMEDY THAT COULD NOT BE MADE OR IMPOSED BY A COURT DECIDING THE MATTER IN THE SAME JURISDICTION. JUDGMENT UPON THE AWARD RENDERED BY SUCH ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OBLIGATION TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, EACH PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AT ANY TIME, FROM ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.

                    <ul class="hanging-indent" type="none">
                        <li>
                            12.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no provision in these Terms is or is intended to be construed as a condition of confidentiality within the scope of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “IRC”) section 6011 as implemented through Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii) (without regard to references to payment or receipt of a minimum fee) or under any similar or analogous provisions of the laws of a state or other jurisdiction. In particular, You may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, tax information AmibianceAccounting provides to You, including all materials such as tax opinions, memoranda, or other written tax advice that describes or otherwise relates to, either or both of the tax treatment and tax structure of any transaction on which AmibianceAccounting’s services are provided. You agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to inform AmibianceAccounting of any conditions of confidentiality imposed by third party advisors with respect to any transaction on which AmibianceAccounting’s services are requested. Such notification must occur prior to AmibianceAccounting providing any advice with respect to the transaction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            12.2 Treasury regulations under IRC section 6011 require taxpayers to disclose to the IRS their participation in reportable transactions and IRC section 6707A imposes strict penalties for noncompliance with IRC section 6011. IRC section 6111 and the laws of various states require a material advisor with respect to a reportable transaction to make a return containing specified information concerning the transaction to the IRS or a designated state tax authority by a prescribed date, and IRC section 6707 imposes penalties for noncompliance with IRC section 6111. IRC section 6112 and the laws of various states require the material advisor to maintain, and make available to the IRS or designated state tax authority upon request, a list containing prescribed information with respect to persons advised and other information with respect to the reportable transaction, and IRC section 6708 imposes penalties for noncompliance with IRC section 6112. You agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to inform AmibianceAccounting if You are required to disclose any transaction covered by the Services as a reportable transaction to the IRS or to any state or other jurisdiction adopting similar or analogous provisions to IRC section 6011. AmibianceAccounting will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform You if AmibianceAccounting provides Your identifying information to the IRS under IRC section 6111 or 6112, or to any state tax authority or other jurisdiction adopting similar or analogous provisions thereto.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            12.3 Unless expressly provided for, AmibianceAccounting’s services do not include representing You in the event of a challenge by the IRS or other tax or revenue authorities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            12.4 In rendering tax advice, AmibianceAccounting may consider, for example, the applicable provisions of the IRC, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, each as amended, and the relevant state, local and foreign statutes, the regulations thereunder, income tax treaties, and judicial and administrative interpretations, thereof. These authorities are subject to change, retroactively or prospectively, and any such changes could affect the validity of AmibianceAccounting’s advice.

                        <li>
                            12.5 <u>Tax Return Standards</u>: We apply elevated standards in preparing tax returns and providing tax advice. These standards are dependent on certain characteristics of the entity to which our services will be directed as follows:
                        </li>
                        <ul class="hanging-indent" type="none">
                            <li>
                                12.5.1 For U.S. public companies or “large private entities” (i.e., private entities with prior year gross revenues of $300 million or more): We must be able to determine that (1) there is “substantial authority” for an undisclosed return position (i.e., the weight of authorities in support of a position is substantial in relation to the weight of authorities in opposition to the position) and (2) a disclosed return position has at least a “realistic possibility” of being sustained on its merits. The laws of some states (e.g., New York) also may impose more stringent return preparation standards for state tax returns. For positions pertaining to a “Tax Shelter” (as defined in IRC §6662(d)(2)(C)(ii)) or a “reportable transaction” with a significant purpose of tax avoidance, the return positions must be at least “more likely than not” to be sustained on the merits; if the taxpayer is advised regarding potential taxpayer penalties, ere must be “substantial authority” for our advice.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                12.5.2 For “individuals or other private entities” (i.e., entities that do not fall within the definitions above as a U.S. public company or large private entity): The return position must be at least “more likely than not” to be sustained on the merits.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                12.5.3 If a return position relates to a transaction that is a “principal purpose transaction,” we must arrive at a “should” confidence level with respect to the position.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                12.5.4 We will not render any advice with respect to a federal or state “listed transaction” or any transaction that is substantially similar to a federal or state “listed transaction.”
                                <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;"></span> In determining whether a return position or tax advice meets the appropriate standard, we will not take into account the possibility that a tax return will not be audited, that an issue will not be raised on audit, or that an issue will be settled. We will inform you as soon as possible if We determine circumstances exist that prevent us from completing the tax return under these standards.
                            </li>

                            12.6 <u>Electronic Filing</u>: We will electronically file the returns and extensions we prepare for You that are subject to tax authority mandates. The filing instructions that We provide to you will indicate the returns and extensions that We have electronically filed on Your behalf, if any, and will provide instructions and filing copies for your paper filing of the returns and extensions that were not electronically filed.
                            <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;"></span> The AmibianceAccounting electronic filing identification number (EFIN) will be included in certain e-filing documentation we will provide to you for the returns e-filed using AmibianceAccounting-licensed software. The AmibianceAccounting EFIN is proprietary to AmibianceAccounting and You are not authorized to use the AmibianceAccounting EFIN for any purpose

                            12.7 <u>Written Advice</u>: Written advice provided to you in connection with the AmibianceAccounting SPARK Services will be based on facts, representations, assumptions, and other information you provide to us, the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of which are critical factors in our ability to timely and accurately complete the AmibianceAccounting SPARK Services. Unless you request and we agree under a separate writing (a newly issued engagement letter) after our advice has been issued in final form to you, AmibianceAccounting will not update our advice to take into account your updating the facts you provide to us through your discovery of new or additional facts, or your updating any information that may have formed the basis of any assumptions we made in developing our advice. In rendering advice, we will consider tax authorities that are subject to change, retroactively and/or prospectively, and any such changes could affect the advice we issue to you.
